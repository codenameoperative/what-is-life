## 💡 **Pro Tips & Strategies**

- **Start Safe (Lv. 1-10)**  Keep a `Revival Bill` in your inventory. Stick to `Search`, `Work`, or short `Stream` sessions until you can afford higher-risk runs.
- **Stack Multipliers**  Combine `Garden` harvest boosts with `Automation` mode to keep WTC flowing while you plan the next upgrade.
- **Gear Gateways**  Always buy activity gear in advance (e.g. `Hunting Rifle`, `Fishing Rod`). Missing items stall your grind and reduce automation efficiency.
- **Momentum Windows**  When `Explore` or `Crime` reward streaks appear, cash in quickly, then return to safer loops before death risk stacks.
- **Multiplayer Prep**  Before joining LAN mini-games, empty excess WTC into the bank to avoid heavy losses during PvP bets.
- **Daily Reset**  Log in once per day even if you cannot grind—daily bonuses stack with the loyalty streak and keep passive timers running.
